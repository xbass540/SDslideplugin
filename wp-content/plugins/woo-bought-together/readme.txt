Technically, this plugin offers a way for shop owners to get all related products together and put them in a deal for an irresistible price. This acts as a great reminder for customers to consider things that they might need to buy alongside the currently being viewed product. Consider the following cases when you need a WPC Frequently Bought Together plugin:

- Give a suggestion to buy a charger alongside with a laptop or computer for 10% off.
- Suggest a suitable jeans and a pair of shoes that fit well with the beautiful shirt being considered. Buyers can get all three items with $20 off.
- Invite customers to buy two more pieces of jewelry from the same collection.
- Combine three products from three different collections and give a 15% discount.
- Allow customers to buy various pattern designs of the same variable product in a deal. (Users must enable Allow same products in the Bought Together settings in order to do this).
- Create a complex deal with additional items’ quantities and prices are adjusted differently. For example, a deal with 3 additional items: item 1 - quantity= 1 & 90% price, item 2 - quantity=2 & 80% price, item 3 - quantity=3 & 75% price. And finally, you put the main product’s price at 20% off. It’s totally possible. See this screenshot http://prntscr.com/piohqc or visit this product on our demo site for your reference.
